Here is a potential security issue in the _amountToSolvency() function. The bug is related to the order of operations within the calculation.

Here is the affected function:

```solidity
function _amountToSolvency(uint96 _id) internal returns (uint256 _usdaToSolvency) {
  _usdaToSolvency = _vaultLiability(_id) - _getVaultBorrowingPower(_getVault(_id));
}
```
The issue lies in the subtraction operation (_vaultLiability(_id) - _getVaultBorrowingPower(_getVault(_id))).

The bug may show itself under the following circumstances:

    When peekCheckVault(_id) is false, i.e., the vault is not solvent.
    When the result of _peekAmountToSolvency(_id) exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the uint256 data type.

Explanation:

The function _amountToSolvency() is used to calculate the amount of USDA needed to reach even solvency for a specific vault. It subtracts the vault's borrowing power from its liability to determine how much additional USDA is required.

However, the bug occurs because the peekCheckVault(_id) function is not called within the _amountToSolvency() function. As a result, there is no validation to check if the vault is solvent before performing the subtraction.

Let's look at the flow of events:

    _usdaToSolvency = _vaultLiability(_id) retrieves the vault's liability.
    _getVaultBorrowingPower(_getVault(_id)) calculates the vault's borrowing power.
    The function returns _usdaToSolvency without verifying if the vault is solvent or not.

If the vault is not solvent, i.e., the peekCheckVault(_id) is false, then the vault's borrowing power may exceed its liability, leading to a negative value during subtraction. In Solidity, unsigned integers (uint) cannot represent negative values, and an underflow will occur.

The underflow will result in the subtraction returning an unexpected large positive value instead of a negative value. This could potentially lead to incorrect calculations and unintended behavior in the contract, including the misallocation of funds.

To fix this issue, it's necessary to add a check for vault solvency using peekCheckVault(_id) before performing the subtraction to prevent the underflow and ensure accurate calculations.
