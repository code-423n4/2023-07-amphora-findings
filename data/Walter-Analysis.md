## Progress
as usual I started looking at the codebase starting from the top of the list of contracts on Code4rena, they were already pretty big contracts (300+ SOLC) which therefore took a lot of energy to look at very well, I got to USDA.sol then I took a half-day break to think about how to proceed with the audit, up to that moment I had scored a little something, on the ipad (collanotes), but it was nothing important, a few lows and gas, then the next day comes and I only discovered dit ,I can honestly say it opened my eyes to how other wardens make reports and how they should be done,I discovered how to manage the prices taken from the Chainlink Oracle,and how to look at each math line and calculations,in fact from here on my strategy went from looking for the little mushrooms (low/gas) to the rarer and bigger hard to find ones (med/high),I started looking for BIG blocks of calculations and I said to myself,there is definitely something wrong here...let's find it!

## Stuff that i learned
as previously mentioned I learned how to manage the prices taken from the Chainlink Oracle and I discovered that I am thrilled to spend many hours trying to calculate until something in the formulas is wrong and you discover a bug ... hopefully.

## Stuff that NEEDS to be improved
time management: i spent like 10 hours in one day and the other 15 in the rest,that's not ok,need to spread those, like 6 a day and more consistent.

### Time spent:
25 hours
