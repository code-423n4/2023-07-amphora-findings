## [L-01] Integer Overflow/Underflow
There are several arithmetic operations in the function, such as `_totalCrvReward += _crvReward` and `_totalCvxReward -= _takenCVX`. That could overflow or underflow depending on user input, it could lead to unexpected behavior, possibly enabling attackers to manipulate rewards. Make sure to use SafeMath or similar techniques to prevent integer overflow and underflow issues.


## [L-02] Unexpected Behavior for Tokens Not Registered or Not Curve LP Collateral
If a token address provided in the _tokenAddresses array is not registered in the controller `(tokenId == 0)` or is not a Curve LP token staked on Convex `(collateralType != CurveLPStakedOnConvex)`, the function reverts. However, this could lead to inconsistent behavior depending on the caller's expectation. Ensure proper handling and messaging for such cases.


## [L-03] Possible ClaimedReward Event Misrepresentation:
The ClaimedReward event is emitted for both CRV and CVX rewards, even if they were not successfully claimed from the external contracts. This could lead to misrepresentation of rewards claimed by the user. Emit the event only after successful transfers of rewards to the user.

## [L-04] Lack of Input Validation
The function assumes that the input `_tokenAddresses` is valid and does not perform input validation. Ensure that the input is properly validated to avoid unexpected behavior.

## [L-05] Inconsistent Event Emissions
The function emits ClaimedReward events for CRV and CVX rewards. However, if the `_amphClaimer.claimable` call reverts, the event emission for the CVX reward would still take place even though the actual transfer doesn't occur. This could lead to inconsistency between events and actual state changes.

## [L-06] Gas Cost for Large Rewards Data
Returning a large Reward[] array as a return value can lead to increased gas costs when calling the function. If possible, consider using events or other mechanisms to report the rewards data instead of returning them in the function call.

## [I-04] Potential Expensive Looping
Looping through all the extra rewards (_rewardsContract.extraRewards) might become expensive if the contract has a large number of extra rewards. Consider finding ways to optimize or reduce the number of loop iterations.

## [I-06] Inefficient Array Indexing:
The function is using an unchecked loop index (_i) to fill in the Reward[] array, which may cause unexpected behavior if the loop count exceeds the array size. Use a standard loop to avoid such issues.

## [NC-01] Combine multiple SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransfer calls into a single transfer to reduce gas cost.

## [NC-02] Reduce external contract calls
Avoid multiple calls to external contracts and try to perform actions within the contract wherever possible.

## [I-01] Avoid unbounded loops
If the number of token addresses in _tokenAddresses is limited, consider manually writing separate code for each token instead of using a loop.

## [I-02] Merge claimable rewards calculation with the rewards claiming logic to avoid repetitive calls to the same function.

## [I-03] Minimize storage reads and writes
If a variable is used multiple times, try to read its value once and store it in a local variable to avoid additional storage reads.
