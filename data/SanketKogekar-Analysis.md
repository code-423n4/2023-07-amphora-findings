- Approach taken in evaluating the codebase:

Going back and forth between docs and codebase. Starting from contract with lowest SLOC and eventually switching to parent contract of the core ones (like Vault, etc.)

Going through user's perspective while skimming through functionality.

- Codebase quality analysis

I would appreciate more commented description of the functions. It helps me move faster. Diagrams are never that useful when compared to text descriptions.

- Centralization risks

The owner has a lot of control, unless the governance is truly decentralized (even though it uses a timelock and certain parameters could be set/changed as needed)
