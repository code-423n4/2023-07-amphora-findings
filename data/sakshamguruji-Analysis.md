Amphora Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers a unique combination of stablecoins, multi-collateral Vaults, and a robust governance system represented by the AMPH token. USDA is the native token
of the system , users borrow USDA and provide collateral to the system. The vaults can be thought of as positions, if the vault is solvent then it can be thought of as "healthy" and if the vault is insolvent that
can be thought as it being "unhealthy" . The solvency is dependent upon the liability of the vaults which is basically the liability/debt in terms of the USDA token.

## 1. Introduction: Amphora Protocol and its Core Features

Amphora Protocol serves as a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem:

### 1.1.
 VaultController: The VaultController is the central hub of the protocol, empowering users to create Vaults and borrow USDA(vaults can be created by anyone), which is the platform's stablecoin. It offers liquidations , if the vault specified is insolvent (baseliability more than the liquidity threshold) then anyone can liquidate that vault and earn fee for it. Additionally, it provides governance functionalities for registering new collaterals and tweaking parameters of existing ones.

### 1.2. 
USDA - The Rebase Stablecoin: USDA, the native stablecoin of Amphora Protocol, introduces a unique rebase mechanism. This rebase feature adjusts user balances based on interest payments, enabling any holder to participate in the protocol's profits passively. Its 1:1 exchange ratio with sUSD adds versatility, and its participation in liquidity mining incentivizes users to engage in the protocol's growth.

### 1.3.
 Multi-Collateral Vaults: Vaults on Amphora Protocol are innovative, supporting multiple types of collateral simultaneously. Users can deposit different collaterals, including Curve LPs, which are staked into Convex, thereby starting to earn yields instantly. Vault owners can conveniently claim these yields whenever they desire, enhancing their capital efficiency.

### 1.4.
 AMPH - The Governance Token: The governance token AMPH empowers holders with voting rights and the ability to propose changes to the protocol's core functionalities. These include adding new collaterals, adjusting LTVs, and other essential parameters, creating a decentralized governance system that fosters community-driven decision-making. A proposal first has to be succeeded then queued then executed.

### 1.5.
 AMPHClaimer and Liquidity Mining: The AMPHClaimer module facilitates the Liquidity Mining program by automatically converting a portion of users' CVX/CRV rewards into AMPH. This program reinforces the governance token's value, incentivizing community participation and alignment with the platform's long-term goals.

### 1.6.
 WUSDA - An Innovative Solution: WUSDA is a groundbreaking feature that addresses the limitations of rebasing tokens in certain protocols. It allows users to deposit USDA and receive WUSDA in return, which increases in value instead of directly impacting user balances. This enables users to withdraw their original USDA along with accumulated interest at their convenience, providing added flexibility in various DeFi environments.
