1): First of all I read all the data given on code4rena website about the protocol and then read a little about the protocol itself, after that searched for the common issues and then moved to the contracts that were lengthy cause they required most amount of time. Lead focus was on price Oracles especially curve.

2): Learned alot of things especially time management and about Convex LP. Learned more use cases of lending/borrowing protocols and about Interest Protocol especiall this
https://interestprotocol.io/book/docs/concepts/Borrowing/InterestRates/#reserve-ratio

3): Limited focus on gas optimization and QA. Efforts to find bugs in GovernorCharlie where alot of issues resulted in false flags. Spotting lack of zero address checks was straightforward. Time constraints affected submission, even didn't had time to submit some.

### Time spent:
