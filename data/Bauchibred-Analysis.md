# Amphora Protocol Analysis Report

## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- Started with the discord chat
- Went ahead to the docs
- Then the codes in scope line by line
- Took a brief look at all audits of the Ampleforth while going throughuFragments.sol, since the idea of uFragments.sol is gotten from there
- Back to the docs to counter some notes I made while going through codebase
- Discussed a few ideas with sponsors to understand their design choice and why I think it's risky or how I can recommend a better method to implement the strategies
- Finally then back to the codebase to sum up my reports/findings

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase

Multiple things, to list a few:

- Convex LPs
- Curve's TriCrypto pool
- Skimmed through the "Interest Protocol" by Gfx Labs (would have to spend more time to really understand this)

### Refresher on previously known topics

Got a deeper understanding of formerly acquainted topics like:

- Oracle integrations
- Rebasing mechanism
- Lending markets
- Some basic solidity & defi concepts

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings

As always I approached the contest first as a learning opportunity and then submit issues I believe should be looked on, I spent around 18 - 23 hours (_~ 21 +/- the distractions I encountered while going through the codes_) spread around 3 days on the contest, I would be waiting for the comments on my findings to find out what I can improve in my reports or why my thought process is wrong.


### Time spent:
