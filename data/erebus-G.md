[Here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-amphora/blob/daae020331404647c661ab534d20093c875483e1/core/solidity/contracts/core/USDA.sol#L259) the function `donation` makes the math to share the donation between all the `USDA` holders. However, if it get to be more than `MAX_SUPPLY`, the `_totalSupply` is set to `MAX_SUPPLY` and it will be doing unnecessary instructions in the `_gonsPerFragment` calculation for the following calls to donation from within the contract (if `_totalSupply` is not reduced). The optimization lies lies in adding an `if (_totalSupply == MAX_SUPPLY) return;` so that it does not spend gas doing redundant instructions when the supply has reached the limit.
